1. Start an EC2 instance: You’ll begin by setting up your AWS account and launching an EC2 instance, which will serve as the server for your application.
2. Change Security group settings: To allow web traffic to reach your application, you’ll need to open the appropriate HTTP/S ports.
3. SSH to the instance: Securely access your server via SSH using the PEM key you created during setup.
4. Provision the server: Set up a non-root user, update system packages, and ensure you have administrative access through this new user.
5. Install Node: Install Node.js on your server using NVM (Node Version Manager), which will allow you to run your application.
6. Setup Git: Configure Git on your server, set up a deploy key, and clone your application repository from GitHub.
7. Build your project: Install your Node project, configure environment variables, build your application, and ensure it’s running correctly.
8. Setup reverse proxy: Install and configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle incoming web traffic and direct it to your application.
9. Setup PM2: Install PM2 to keep your application running in the background, even after you log out of your server.
10. Setup domain name: Link your application to a domain name using Route53 or another domain registrar.
11. Setup SSL: Secure your application with HTTPS by obtaining an SSL certificate through LetsEncrypt and configuring Nginx to handle SSL.
12. Improve security: Tighten the security of your server by disabling unnecessary ports, improving SSH settings, and ensuring secure user access.
